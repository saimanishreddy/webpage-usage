# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple web application deployed on AWS EC2 that collects user input through a web form and stores the data in a database. The solution will include both the infrastructure setup using CloudFormation and the Python application code, with proper documentation for deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a simple web form through a browser, so that I can input data that will be stored in a database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the web application URL THEN the system SHALL display a simple HTML form
2. WHEN a user fills out the form with data THEN the system SHALL accept text input fields
3. WHEN a user submits the form THEN the system SHALL provide feedback that the submission was successful

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my form submissions to be permanently stored, so that the data is not lost and can be retrieved later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits form data THEN the system SHALL store the data in a database
2. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure data persistence across application restarts
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL handle database connection errors gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want infrastructure as code using CloudFormation with EC2, so that I can easily deploy and manage the AWS resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use CloudFormation templates
2. WHEN creating resources THEN the system SHALL include an EC2 instance for hosting the web application
3. WHEN creating resources THEN the system SHALL include a database (RDS MySQL/PostgreSQL)
4. WHEN creating resources THEN the system SHALL include proper security groups and IAM roles
5. WHEN creating EC2 instance THEN the system SHALL configure it with appropriate user data for application setup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Python web application running on EC2, so that I can handle HTTP requests and database operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the application THEN the system SHALL use Python as the programming language
2. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL use Flask web framework
3. WHEN connecting to database THEN the system SHALL use appropriate database drivers (pymysql or psycopg2)
4. WHEN processing forms THEN the system SHALL validate input data
5. WHEN running on EC2 THEN the system SHALL be configured to start automatically on instance boot

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and setup instructions, so that I can easily deploy the application to AWS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing documentation THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step deployment instructions
2. WHEN documenting setup THEN the system SHALL include prerequisites and dependencies
3. WHEN documenting deployment THEN the system SHALL include AWS CLI commands and CloudFormation deployment steps
4. WHEN documenting the application THEN the system SHALL include local testing instructions
5. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL have separate folders for app and infrastructure setup
